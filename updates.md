## Update Nr 4

## Update Nr 2 • 2017-03-18 • Jekyll

My own portfolio has always been an uphill battle for me because I always end up trying to pick up new knowledge as I’m working on it. That approach is much harder to take on a client project with a deadline.

This website runs on Jekyll. That has some nice benefits: it should mainly make the website snappy. The reason why I’ve invested some time in Jekyll though is because it seems like a reasonably future proof option. It’s open source, yes, but it’s also pretty mature. It’s been around since 2008 and there are a bunch of smart, helpful people writing about how to do smart helpful things with Jekyll.

For someone that is pretty comfortable with HTML and CSS it’s a pleasurable extension of the things that you already know.

Although Jekyll does tons of things, the most important part to me is that it feels almost like an extension of pure HTML. Much like what SASS is to CSS.

It’s not so much about perfectionism as it is about wanting to know what’s happening underneath.
