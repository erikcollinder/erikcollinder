# Good reasons to give me a shout


## Approach

It's helpful for clients and colleagues alike to know what I _think_. To be challanged and revised of course.

- Modular Design. The execution of any design these days has to be highly modular.
- Typographic Focus. One of the more technical problem of visual design is type, but it's also at its core.
- Mobile First. No, but really, as far as information and interaction design goes: always start with the small canvases. It's much easier to upscale small layots than it is to shrink a large one.
