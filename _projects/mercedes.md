title: Mercedes-Benz Forgotten Roadtrip
subtitle: Cinemagraph storytelling and Art Direction
description: To launch the Mercedes-Benz GLA 2015 they wanted to try something a little different. Rather than shooting out a normal TV spot they involved Jung von Matt, B-reel and myself to create a vast interactive narrative. As the reader scrolls down the piece, Ryan's memory comes back and hurls him through a journey through the desert and into the city of Los Angeles.
