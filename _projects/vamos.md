Trying to see if I could write and post stuff ton my bloody iPad to a Jekyll blog. I suppose this should work and show up straight on the erikcollinder.github.io site.

I'm _also_ working out what it feels like to type on an iPad. It's not bad. I miss the slightly longer travel of a MacBook Pro I guess but then maybe I could get used to this with a bit of touch typing training. 

The software if the iPad is not there yet. It's just immature I suppose but it's getting better every month, every year.
