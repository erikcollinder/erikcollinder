subtitle: Co-Founding and Art Direction
client: vamos
description: "Gatherings and events are happening everywhere and all the time, but how do you keep up with where and when – maybe more important: how do you know what you'll like? My co-founders and myself aimed to answer these questions with an iOS and Android App, that makes it easy to know where to crowd will go to."
