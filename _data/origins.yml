    My start is un-profound: As a kid I had a knack for drawing. I'm terrible at remembering things that happened over a week ago but I can recall the thrill of being able to replicate the characters of comic books. To this day I relish the feeling of making anything that “looks like the real thing”. Another great feeling is when you get good enough at something that you
    I picked up a tremendous amount of knowledge about Photoshop. I sometimes half-joke that I must have had too few friends one summer but it's certainly worth acknowledging how much focus and time I had access to as a child. Having abundant focus and time is something I still strive for; knowing how fast you can go when devoting your mind to that one thing."

    With these technical skills at hand I started out working as a graphic design intern when I was merely 14. I knew virtually nothing about *design* and I was arguably *too* young but at the time it was excitement beyond belief. I got to work on real projects with the kindest people. One woman told me I was like an "old man in a young boy's body" and my pretentious self was stoked.
    All the parts required for the dream of a graphic designer started to assemble.

    At this point I was ready to leave education. We finished high school in 2010 (???)

    I got in touch with B-reel while finishing High School and we arranged for another internship, but this time in London. A few months later I was hired and this time the executional bar was raised. Agencies might have a rep for being tough but for cutting your teeth it's perfect. This is a place where quality of the output always was very high. From the first presentation to the art-working of the deliverables.

    Back in London I bumped into a key figure in my life, Luis Alegría. He had this drive that me and co-founders could tap into. So we started Vamos: The Event Guide. It was a completely different way of designing. Quick results mattered instead of a polished reinforcement of an idea. To some people, this is the most obvious thing in the world, but it took me a long time to fully internalise this.

    I still live in Berlin even though I've had the fortune to sometimes get shipped over to places like Los Angeles, Stockholm and Sao Paolo to work. It's always a gift to get to work with new people in a new place.

    In 2016 I met my new professional partner Malte Schonvogel. We're going to attempt a new venture and I'm really thrilled about it.
