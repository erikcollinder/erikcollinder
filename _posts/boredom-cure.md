"I'm feeling inspired so I'm going to try my hardest to be more productive, from now on".

You want to make friends in a new city. Easy: Walk down a busy street and fixate on a person you think looks alright. Now, all you have to do is try your absolute hardest to make them your friend. Give it your all. When you're done, drink some water, give some more.

This is a poorly written joke. No adult does this, because it's intuitively a dumb idea – we've already tried it a few times as kids. Friends are very important to people so we will go to great lengths to not appear *try-hard*. Additionally, we take great care nurturing the conditions that allow people to like us; take regular showers, dress up to our clan style guide, do people favours, go to [cool bars](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/secretly-hate-bars.html), and keep our opinions in check to make sure they're still acceptable.

Trying to be 'productive' seems similarly pointless. I've learned a false system of thought when it comes to this stuff. To produce, to make, to create has always been framed as either a pleasant outlet or a sleepless agony. A loud and drunk outburst of colour or a tortured soul stuck in the dark. Always a voilent exchange between the maker and their surroundings.

These images are powerful but hurtful if pursuing actual making. Creativity and productivity is born of Boredom. There might be more suitable words, especially in other languages but arguing over the precise definition is of no help. Because boredom is simple – easy to relate to. Make yourself bored enough and something will happen. Output will come. This sounds joky but within lies something worthwhile. 

As long as you're awake, your mind naturally will work hard and fast. *Regardless* of what you do, tirelessly it will go on for about 16 hours. Arguably practising a mediative activity might slow things down, but the default state is constant frantic[^1] thinking.

It's easier to have our mind work with stuff that disguise as neutral or inconsequential. Scrolling through social networks and news-feeds or watching a great show.

I'm borrowing from my novice meditation practise here but presume it's useless to _strive_ for productive output.

Instead, consider productive output a physical place, like a room in a strangers house. In this room, useful work happens. Here we're no longer procrastinating but dealing with your life in an orderly way. We're following your todo-list from top to bottom, and nothing is out of control. It doesn't take any effort to do these things because this is the only thing to do here.

Let's not dwell on them but many things, services and people will want you to be elsewhere. Some people have high tolerance to these interruptions but I don't. Browsing any unlimited source of commentary on almost any subject will suck me in.



If productive output is a place and not a state, it also can't be turned on or off. To get to a restaurant one has to create the conditions.

> Note: Need a metaphor for things that can not be tried for, but where the *conditions* are right for something to occur. Obviously, fucking plants, but that's maybe a bit boring.  

Put nothing else in front of you but the work, and you will probably do it. 

[^1]: Not to be confused with hard and *slow* thinking. As explained by Daniel Kahnemann, this does not happen very much.
